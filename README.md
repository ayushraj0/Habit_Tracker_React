## ü¶â Main information

A habit tracker project in React is a web application that allows users to track their daily habits. 
The application provides a user interface for creating, editing, and deleting habits, as well as tracking progress over time.

For storing the user's habits and progress, you can use a database or a state management library like Redux. You can create actions and reducers to handle adding, updating, and deleting habits, as well as updating the user's progress data.
